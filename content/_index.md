# Hi!  
I am Rei Anderson, I am a low-level developer with experience in many languages. This sites purpose is primarily as a portfolio and will most likely house more things as my experience grows.

## Skills  
My hope is the longer this site exists the more in depth this list will get! I love learning new skills and filling out the niches of my knowledge when it comes to computers. 

- Raw socket programming
- Higher level protocol network programming
- OS specific internals ([see hobkey](@/projects/hobkey.md))
- Relational database management and composition
- IPC Protocol development and usage
- IEEE802.11 internals

## Programming languages
I love picking up new (and interesting) programming languages. I tend to do it as a hobby so this list will be quite eclectic. I will label the ones I am more comfortable with and used the most.  
  
### Most Comfortable
- Rust
- C++ (primarily C++17, learning newer versions)
- C 
- Python

### For fun
- Haskell
- Javascript/Typescript
- Java
- Kotlin
